# Egg_catcher game
 
 
 **DESCRIPTION OF GAME**
 
 The _EGG CATCHER_ is a classic game which laid foundation for many game theories at that time. 
 I developed a simple egg catcher game using python and its modules.

_RULES_

The game has simple rules - 
1. The player needs to collect each egg falling from the sky.
2. For each egg collected, he will be rewarded 10 points.
3. The speed of falling of eggs from sky increases after a fixed interval of time.
4. Player has '3' lives. For each egg that is not collected, a life is deducted. The game is over when the player drops 3 eggs.

Modules used in the code - 
-> Itertools
-> Random
-> Tkinter
